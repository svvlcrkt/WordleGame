# <i>WordleGame<i>

## <i>2021 – 2022 SPRING CMP2004 Advanced Programming Term Project<i> 

<i>You are expected to implement a simple wordle game with the following scenario:
You need to create a meaningful word database. There 5 tries. On each trial, the user
needs to enter 5 characters and these characters must be matched with the database. If the
user finds a correct letter in the correct position that letter’s color change to green but if it is in
the wrong position, that time color must be yellow.<i>

### <i>Minimum Criteria:<i>
• <i>Proper object-oriented (OO) hierarchy (Use concepts of interfaces, and abstract
classes while designing OO hierarchy)<br><i>
• <i>You need to create one wordle puzzle. <br><i>
• <i>On the opening page, the user needs to select keyboard play or drag and drop play.<br><i>
• <i>Keyboard play means the user can enter letters using the keyboard.<br><i>
• <i>Drag and drop play means the user needs to drag and drop letters to puzzle.<br><i>
• <i>You need to use the mouse or key listeners<br><i>
• <i>Minimal GUI elements (Minimal a button, a checkbox, and a text field)<br><i>
• <i>You need to show time information using GUI elements.<br><i>
• <i>End of the game, you need to show suitable animations. (For example, if the user found
the word, confetti will show on the frame.)<br><i>
• <i>Graphics (Java 2D API usage while designing your graphical elements)<br><i>
• <i>Create a jar file<br><i>
• <i>You need to show high score and store it in a file. <br><i>
• <i>Two users play in one frame with the same puzzles <br><i>
• <i>Visitors can watch the game<br><i>
• <i>You need to load high score information from a file.<br><i>
• <i>You need store and show detailed statistics about user letter usage.<i>
