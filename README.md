# WordleGame

2021 – 2022 SPRING
CMP2004 Advanced Programming
Term Project 

You are expected to implement a simple wordle game with the following scenario:
You need to create a meaningful word database. There 5 tries. On each trial, the user
needs to enter 5 characters and these characters must be matched with the database. If the
user finds a correct letter in the correct position that letter’s color change to green but if it is in
the wrong position, that time color must be yellow.

### Minimum Criteria:
 You are expected to design the game by using java. Below are the minimal criteria:
• Proper object-oriented (OO) hierarchy (Use concepts of interfaces, and abstract
classes while designing OO hierarchy)
• You need to create one wordle puzzle.
• On the opening page, the user needs to select keyboard play or drag and drop play.
• Keyboard play means the user can enter letters using the keyboard.
• Drag and drop play means the user needs to drag and drop letters to puzzle.
• You need to use the mouse or key listeners
• Minimal GUI elements (Minimal a button, a checkbox, and a text field)
• You need to show time information using GUI elements.
• End of the game, you need to show suitable animations. (For example, if the user found
the word, confetti will show on the frame.)
• Graphics (Java 2D API usage while designing your graphical elements)
• Create a jar file
• You need to show high score and store it in a file. 
• Two users play in one frame with the same puzzles 
• Visitors can watch the game
• You need to load high score information from a file.
• You need store and show detailed statistics about user letter usage.
