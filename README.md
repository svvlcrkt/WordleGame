2021 – 2022 SPRING
CMP2004 Advanced Programming
Term Project 

You are expected to implement a simple wordle game with the following scenario:
You need to create a meaningful word database. There 5 tries. On each trial, the user
needs to enter 5 characters and these characters must be matched with the database. If the
user finds a correct letter in the correct position that letter’s color change to green but if it is in
the wrong position, that time color must be yellow.

### Minimum Criteria:
• Proper object-oriented (OO) hierarchy (Use concepts of interfaces, and abstract
classes while designing OO hierarchy)<br>
• You need to create one wordle puzzle. <br>
• On the opening page, the user needs to select keyboard play or drag and drop play.<br>
• Keyboard play means the user can enter letters using the keyboard.<br>
• Drag and drop play means the user needs to drag and drop letters to puzzle.<br>
• You need to use the mouse or key listeners<br>
• Minimal GUI elements (Minimal a button, a checkbox, and a text field)<br>
• You need to show time information using GUI elements.<br>
• End of the game, you need to show suitable animations. (For example, if the user found
the word, confetti will show on the frame.)<br>
• Graphics (Java 2D API usage while designing your graphical elements)<br>
• Create a jar file<br>
• You need to show high score and store it in a file. <br>
• Two users play in one frame with the same puzzles <br>
• Visitors can watch the game<br>
• You need to load high score information from a file.<br>
• You need store and show detailed statistics about user letter usage.
